# CurrencyConvertor
A program created in java that converts currencies using fastForex API


## Purpose of the code:
I created this to just practice my skills and to provide an interface that can convert different currencies. It uses fastForex conversion API and it is free to use.

## Generating API:
Create an account on [FastForex](https://www.fastforex.io/) and generate your API key, paste it in the software and it will work.
